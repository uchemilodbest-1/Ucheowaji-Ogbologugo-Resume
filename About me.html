        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a highly analytical, delivery-focused Senior Business Analyst with a strong technical mindset and a deep appreciation of how people, processes, data, and technology interact.
        </p>
        <p>
            My career spans:<br />
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Financial Services:</strong> complex regulatory, compliance, and digital transformation programmes.</li>
                <li><strong>Public Sector / Education:</strong> digital service design, governance, and system modernisation.</li>
                <li><strong>IT and Digital Platforms:</strong> cloud migration, microservices, enterprise APIs, CRM, and IT service management.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            I thrive in environments where: <br />
            <ul>
                <li>Problems are complex and ambiguous.</li>
                <li>Stakeholders have competing priorities.</li>
                <li>Decisions require structured evidence and clear articulation.</li>
                <li>Solutions must balance user needs, technical feasibility, and business value.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            I am equally comfortable working independently or within multidisciplinary teams. I am known for clarity of thinking, strong communication, and the ability to influence without authority.
